# RobotDrawerEditor
A C++ Windows desktop editor made with SFML. This is an old project. After trying SFML with the Battleships project I decided to use the UI created there in some UI-centered project like an editor. It was supposed to be a vector graphics editor for my planned Arduino robot arm for drawing (made in 2019)
