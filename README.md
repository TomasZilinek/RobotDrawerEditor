# RobotDrawerEditor
A C++ Windows desktop editor made with SFML. This is an old project. After trying SFML with the [Battleships project](https://github.com/TomasZilinek/Battleships) I decided to use the UI created there in some UI-centered project like an editor. It was supposed to be a vector graphics editor for my planned Arduino robot arm for drawing (made in 2019)

In the Battleships project I created myself quite a nice little "library" of UP components like labels, buttons... I wanted to continue developing this library and use it in a more serious project. So I programed more and edited and added TextLabel, ImageLabel, TextButton, ImageButton, TextEntry, DropdownMenu and SelectButtonBar.

After programming all the UI components I was too exhausted. I had a little C++ ptsd and decided to discontinue the project. It has the editor layout and the components work but it doesn't do anything. The <b>main highlight</b> of the project are the UI components.
